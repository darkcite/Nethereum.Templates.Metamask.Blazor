<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Web3Gems is an innovative marketplace that connects gem miners and craftsmen with potential buyers through the power of blockchain technology. We offer a unique opportunity to own not just an NFT, but also a physical gem like a sapphire or an emerald, right after they have been mined and cut to their final shape. The gem you buy will be shipped to you free of charge, anywhere in the world. The NFT you purchase represents the ownership of the gem, and should you wish to resell it, we facilitate the transition of the gem from the current owner to the buyer. We are passionate believers in the potential of Web3 and decentralization, and we've built Web3Gems with strict adherence to the canons and patterns of decentralized apps (dApps).</p>
